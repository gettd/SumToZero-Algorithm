# Sum To Zero

Given the list of integers $L = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$

Write an $O(n^2)$ function to return the unique triplets $(a_i, a_j, a_k)$
where $i, j,$ and $k$ are distinct indices, and $a_i + a_j + a_k = 0$.

You may assume that the resultant set of triplets does not include any duplicates.

### Constraints

- All Built-in sorting functions, dictionaries, and hash maps are prohibited.
- $3 \leq n \leq 3000$
- $-10^6 \leq a_i \leq 10^6$, for all $1 \leq i \leq n$
